 Difference between getElementById, getElementsByClassName, querySelector, querySelectorAll

When working with the DOM, these methods are used to select elements, but they behave differently.
getElementById() is used when you want to grab one specific element using its unique ID. Since an ID should only appear once in a page, this method always returns a single element.
getElementsByClassName() is used when multiple elements share the same class. It gives you a collection of elements. One important thing is that this collection updates automatically if the DOM changes.
querySelector() is more flexible. It works like CSS. You can select by ID, class, tag, or even complex selectors. But it only returns the first matching element.
querySelectorAll() is similar to querySelector(), but instead of returning just one, it returns all matching elements. However, unlike getElementsByClassName(), it does not automatically update if the DOM changes.

 How to create and insert a new element into the DOM

To add a new element to a webpage using JavaScript, you normally follow three steps:
First, create the element using document.createElement().
Second, add content to it (like text or HTML).
Third, insert it somewhere in the page using methods like appendChild() or append().
For example, if you want to add a new paragraph to the body:
Create a paragraph
Set its text
Append it to document.body
That’s it. JavaScript builds the element first in memory, then attaches it to the actual page.

 What is Event Bubbling?

Event bubbling is how events move inside the DOM.
When you click on an element (for example, a button inside a div), the event doesn’t just stay on the button. It first runs on the button, then moves upward to its parent, then to the parent’s parent, and so on — until it reaches the document.

So, the event travels from the innermost element outward.
This is why sometimes clicking a child element also triggers the parent’s event listener.

 What is Event Delegation? Why is it useful?

Event delegation is a smart way to handle events.
Instead of adding separate event listeners to many child elements, you attach one event listener to their parent. Then, inside that parent listener, you check which child triggered the event.
This works because of event bubbling.
Why it’s useful:
Improves performance (less listeners in memory)
Cleaner code
Works even if new elements are added dynamically later
It’s very helpful in projects like job lists, dashboards, or dynamic cards.

 Difference between preventDefault() and stopPropagation()

These two methods are often confused, but they do different things.
preventDefault() stops the browser’s default behavior.
Example: stopping a form from submitting or preventing a link from navigating.
stopPropagation() stops the event from moving upward in the DOM.
It prevents parent elements from receiving the same event.

So:
preventDefault() → stops browser action
stopPropagation() → stops event movement
